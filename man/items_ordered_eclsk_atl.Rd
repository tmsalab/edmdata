\section{Data pre-processing}{

The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten (ECLS-K) has been
subset down both the number of observations and variables. In particular,
only observations without any missing values from a set of reduced
variables -- given above -- are included. If additional data is required,
please visit the data download page found in the reference section.
}

\section{Answer coding}{

Parents and teachers each answered a set of survey items involving a
likert scale that ranged from "1 = never" to "4 = very often" regarding the
subject. Within the teacher responses, they also  had the option of marking
"-7 = no opportunity to observe" option, which was treated as a missing
observation. To align with \emph{C++}, we perform a index shift backward of 1
and, thus, make the scale "0=never" to "3=very often".
