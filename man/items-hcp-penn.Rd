\description{
Trial data from Form A of an abbreviated version of the
Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012).
Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing.
The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern.
The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty.
However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row.

\section{Data Cleaning}{

The \code{items_hcp_penn} data set includes \eqn{N = 1,201} observations.
However, the observation count was calculated after removing participants
that did not respond to any questions (Subject ID's:
117728, 137431, 145531, 236130, and 614439). From there, we generated the
\code{items_hcp_penn_missing} data set that retains a missing data structure
after the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row.
